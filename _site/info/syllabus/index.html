<p><strong>Curving: </strong>The grade  scale above represents the <em>minimum</em> letter grade you will be assigned—at the instructor’s discretion, the grading scale  may be altered <em>in the students’ favor</em> if this will be better reflect the students’ mastery of the material. Thus, <em>if</em> there is a "curve", it will be applied at the <em>end</em>, not to individual assignments.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p><strong>A+ grades: </strong>These may be awarded to the very best performing students in the class—but the cutoff for A+ grades will be determined at the end of the course at the discretion of the instructor (there is no pre-determined cutoff—an average of 97 or more doesn’t guarantee you an A+ grade.)

<strong><em>Everything</em> is cumulative—that’s just how CS is.</strong></p>
<p>Finally—note that just as in a math class, everything we do builds on all the work that came before. So, <em>everything</em> is <em>cumulative</em>—so, you can’t afford to miss any classes unless absolutely necessary. Miss two lectures in a 10-week two-lecture per week course, and you’ve already skipped exactly 10% of the course—it wouldn’t be surprising if your performance (i.e. final grade) in the course dipped by a similar amount.

## Required Resources

* Required textbook: Michael Main and Walter Savitch. Data Structures and Other Objects Using C++ (4th edition), Addison-Wesley, 2011.

* Recommended textbook: Problem Solving with C++, Walter Savitch, Edition 9. Available for purchase at the UCSB book store

* Peer Instruction : iClickers: The course lectures will follow a Peer Instruction format, a teaching model which places stronger emphasis on classroom discussion and student interaction. As part of this you will need to own an iClicker register it on the <a href="">Gauchospace</a>. Be sure to register your clicker by the end of the first week.


## What you should know to be ready for CS24

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the  list of a few important things you’ll need to know to be ready for CS24.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A few of the basic data types of C++, including at least, int, double, char, bool, string</li>
  <li>The basic control structures of C++ (if/else, while, for etc.)</li>
  <li>Defining functions in C++, and passing parameters to functions in three different ways (by value, by pointer, and by reference)</li>
  <li>Scope and lifetime of variables in C++</li>
  <li>The use of “const” with parameters to functions</li>
  <li>Using arrays in C++, and C-strings (null-terminated character arrays)</li>
  <li>How arrays are passed to functions, and the relationship between arrays and pointers</li>
  <li>Defining and working with structs in C++</li>
  <li>Using structs to create singly linked lists where the space for the list nodes is allocated on the heap</li>
  <li>The difference between space allocated on the stack (e.g. local variables) and space allocated on the heap (with the new and delete operators)</li>
  <li>Converting from binary to decimal, octal, and hex, and back again—and how this relates to how C++ programs store various kinds of data in memory.</li>
  <li>The basic principles of recursion, and some idea of when a recursive solution is appropriate.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="course-objectives">Course objectives</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Students learn object-based programming techniques: abstraction and encapsulation.</li>
  <li>Students learn to specify, implement and apply lists, trees and other data structures.</li>
  <li>Students are exposed to complexity analysis, and learn to distinguish algorithms and data structures on the basis of efficiency.</li>
  <li>Students learn (and practice) to produce better programs more quickly and with less stress.</li>
</ul>
