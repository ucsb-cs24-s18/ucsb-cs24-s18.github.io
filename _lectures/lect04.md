## Operator overloading - Pages 63 - 80 in the book

We will start with a basic implementation of the point class from Chapter 2. We will then augment the class with binary operator functions. By **overloading** certain operators like ==, we can now write code as shown below:

```
point p1, p2;
if (p1 == p2){
  cout<<"Points are equal\n";
}
```
We will specifically discuss:

1. Overloading binary comparison operators e.g. ==
2. Overloading binary arithmetic operators e.g. +
3. Overloading output and input operators e.g. >> and <<
